type t
(** Type for mapping from symbols to addresses *)

val empty : t

val of_seq : (string * Address.t) Seq.t -> t

val from_binary_section : X86_emitter.buffer addressed -> t
(** Create a mapping for all symbols in the given section. Some symbols
    that should be available globally, such as ["caml_absf_mask"] will not
    be ignored so that we always use the global ones. *)

val strict_union : t -> t -> t
(** Returns the union of two symbols mappings. Raises an exception if there
    are conflicts.
    Should be used for merging symbols mappings for different sections
    of a single compilation unit, e.g. of a single toplevel phrase. *)

val aggregate : current:t -> new_symbols:t -> t
(** [aggregate ~current ~new_symbols] returns the union of [current] and
    [new_symbols].
    Raises an exception if there are conflicts except for ["caml_apply*"] and
    ["caml_curry*"] which are expected to be generated several times in a
    toplevel session.
    When there is a conflict for those symbols, the returned mapping will
    contain the symbol from [new_symbols]. *)

val find : t -> string -> Address.t option
(** Lookup a symbol's address in the given symbol map. If it is missing from the map
    look it up using dlsym. *)

val dprint : t -> unit
(** Debug printer for symbol table *)
